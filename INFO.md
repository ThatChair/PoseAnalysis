# Information/Tutorial

Using this app is pretty simple. First, make sure a video is ready. The video should be taken from an angle that minimizes obstruction of limbs, trimmed to only the necessary length, and in .MP4 format.
(Slo-Mo video does increase accuracy)

## Importing the Video

 - To import the video, click File -> Import -> Video, then navigate to the file in the folder.

**The video may take quite a while to load, especially on slow devices! Be patient!**
