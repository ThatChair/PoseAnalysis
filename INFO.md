# Information/Tutorial

Using this app is pretty simple. First, you need to make sure you have a video ready. The video should be taken from an angle that minimizes obstruction of limbs, trimmed to only the necessary length, and in .MP4 format
(Slo-Mo does increase accuracy)

## Importing the Video

 - To import the video, you need to click File -> Import -> Video, then navigate to the file in your folder.

**The video may take quite a while to load, especially on slow devices! Be patient!**

## Viewing the Video

 - Once the video has loaded, you can navigate the animation by either clicking the play button in the bottom left, or clicking and dragging on the time bar to go to different parts of the animation

## Navigating the 3D animation

 - To rotate your view of the animation, you can simply click and drag
 - To zoom in, you need a mouse (touchpad does not work currently) or a touchscreen. You either scrool or click and drag with two fingers to zoom

## Exporting the 3D animation

 - To export the animation, simply click File -> Export then navigate to where you wish to export it
